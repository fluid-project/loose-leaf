# Table

The `<table>` element supports an optional `<caption>` as well as column headers,
row headers, or both. It has a responsive layout using the technique described
by Adrian Roselli in his blog post ["Under-Engineered Responsive Tables"](https://adrianroselli.com/2020/11/under-engineered-responsive-tables.html).
